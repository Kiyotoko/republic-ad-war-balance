Why does this submod exist? In RaW, many units are simply overpowered. If you have ever experienced a good Acclamator Spammer, or the endless bombing runs of ARC-170's to the Providence powerhouse, then you know what I mean. At the same time, it is unlikely that you have ever played against a Wavecrest, simply because this ship is so weak that no one uses it. The goal of this submod is to change that balance: every buildable unit should have a purpose and a role in your fleet. No unit should be so powerful that it is the only unit you build for the rest of the battle, or so powerless that you never build it at all. Disclaimer This is a unofficial submod of RaW! All credits go to the original creators! You can find the original mod here . Changes This mod rebalances many space units from RaW for space multiplayer. I am currently working on rebalancing the ground battles and galactic conquest. However, this will take some time. Please note that this mod only focuses on multiplayer battles with other players. Therefore campaigns that can only be played in singleplayer will receive no rebalancing in the near future. Release v1.0 will therefore only cover the space skirmishes. You can find the full changelog here and here . Requesting features and reporting bugs Do you have a problem with a unit? Have you found a bug or do you think something urgently needs balancing? Then please help with the development of this mod by opening an issue. You can open an issue here (bugs), here (feature requests) and here (both).
